# LoL - API Challenge
This Github repo is made for LoL API Challenge @RiotGamesAPI. This was an URF specific challenge more information can be found [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/riot-games-api/show/bX8Z86bm).<br>
The result of this project is a website which is [lelking.com](http://www.lelking.com/). The project is made in [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and a further explanation about everything on this repo is below.
## What is meteor? And why?
> Meteor is a complete open source platform for building web and mobile apps in pure JavaScript
 - Well, that sums it up pretty much. Coffeescipt was used instead of JavaScript. Sorry, all you JavaScript freaks. Meteor is build on NodeJS, which probably was used a lot in this API Challenge. NodeJS was purposely avoided because it really takes a lot of your time when writing real-time responsive apps. Time was something that was very limited and another reason was based on the fact that the app had to pull data, update the database and render the view in real-time. Fortunately everything changed after URF stopped and all the data could be pulled only one time.
##Where's the server code at?
